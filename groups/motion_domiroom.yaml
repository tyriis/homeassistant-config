# entities: list REQUIRED
# Array or comma delimited string, list of entities to group.

# Set this to true if the group state should only turn on if all grouped entities are on.

# Group behavior
# By default when any member of a group is on then the group will also be on.
# Similarly with a device tracker, when any member of the group is home then the group is home.
# If you set the all option to true though, this behavior is inverted and all members of the group have to be on for the group to turn on as well.
