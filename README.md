## About The Project

![Product Overview][product-overview]

Enable GitOps workflows for home-assistant configuration files.

Here's why:

- GitOps is my method of choice when applying configurations to a system in this case our system is home-assistant.
- Changes in the repo are auto applyed, it is transparent who has changed what and when.
- Just make your life easyer and edit your home-assistant config in your editor of choice and use known development workflows and tools :smile:

This repo was heavily inspired by [budimanjojo][budimanjojo-blog], thanks a lot for your work and the hints.
