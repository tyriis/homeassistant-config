# given the sensor sensor.sensor_heating_sensor_heating_temperature_max and the sensor sensor.sensor_heating_sensor_heating_temperature_min
# sensor.sensor_heating_sensor_heating_temperature_flow_groundfloor and sensor.sensor_heating_sensor_heating_temperature_flow_upstairs
# and the switch switch.aqara_heating_valve_l1 and switch.aqara_heating_valve_l2 controlling a valve, while l2 is closing the valve when activated, l1 is opening the valve.
# assure only one of the switches is on at a time, and control the flow temperature to be between min and max
# only switch l1 or l2 on for max 5seconds to avoid overheating or overcooling
# re-evaluate each minute, assure valve get closed if for some reason like a restart the valce is still on?!
