# # and the switch switch.aqara_heating_valve_l1 and switch.aqara_heating_valve_l2 controlling a valve, while l2 is closing the valve when activated, l1 is opening the valve.
# # assure only one of the switches is on at a time, and control the flow temperature to be between min and max
# # only switch l1 or l2 on for max 5seconds to avoid overheating or overcooling
# # re-evaluate each minute, assure valve get closed if for some reason like a restart the valce is still on?!
