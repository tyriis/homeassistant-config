# create a new automation for homeassistant:
# light.office should turn on if one of the motion sensors
# group.motion_office is on and the light is off
# light.office should switch to the scene reading between 06:00 and 08:00
# light.office should switch to the scene working between 08:00 and 12:00
# light.office should switch to the scene concentration between 12:00 and 14:00
# light.office should switch to the scene working between 14:00 and 21:00
# light.office should switch to the scene evening between 21:00 and 00:00
# light.office should switch to the scene night between 00:00 and 06:00
# when the light is on and there is no motion on the group.motion_office for 15 minutes between 08:00 and 00:00, the light should switch to scene relax
# when the light is on and there is no motion on the group.motion_office for 20 minutes between 08:00 and 00:00, the light should switch off
# when the light is on and there is no motion on the group.motion_office for 10 minutes between 00:00 and 08:00, the light should switch off
