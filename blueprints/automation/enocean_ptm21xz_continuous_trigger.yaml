  name: EnOcean PTM 21xZ/ZE (MQTT trigger) with Continuous Actions (v3)
  description: |
    Controller automation for executing **press/hold/release** actions triggered by EnOcean PTM 21xZ/ZE switch.

    **Enhanced with continuous triggering support:**
    - Initial press action
    - Continuous repeat actions while held (configurable interval)
    - Hold actions (after initial hold delay)
    - Release actions

    **PTM216Z**
    Make sure to manually create a separate **Text Helper** and define its entity in the automation. It is used to store the last controller event to filter and handle `button hold` actions.

    **SETTINGS**
    In this tab, there is the possibility to change different parameters.
      - **Base topic**
      - **Hold delay**
      - **Repeat interval** (for continuous actions)
      - **PTM216Z - Specific settings**
